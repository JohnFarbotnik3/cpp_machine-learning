* create a logistics structure to pass into propagate() and backpropagate()
to collection (and visualize) information about the training process.

* create optimized variants of the simplified network modules in the "networks"
folder by copying file, appending "_o1", "_o2", etc. and then optimizing whatever looks like
it will produce the biggest speedup.
^ in particular, reducing size of neuron structures by extracting values/value-histories from neurons,
as well as per-iteration loss, in order to get better data-locality.

? should we train biases at all?
	- what to biases contribute to a machine learning model?
	- how are biases trained differently from weights?
